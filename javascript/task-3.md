# Poor Naming Conventions

## Introduction

The variable and function names in this code are cryptic and do not convey their purpose. This makes the code hard to read and understand.

## Hint

- Rename variables and functions to be more descriptive.
- Use meaningful names that reflect the intent of the code.

## Code

```javascript
function c(a, b) {
  let x = a + b;
  if (x > 10) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```
