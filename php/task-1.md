# Task 1: Poor Naming and Lack of Function Extraction

## Introduction

Welcome to Task 1 of our Clean Code Refactoring Workshop! In this task, we'll be focusing on improving the readability and clarity of code by addressing poor naming and the lack of function extraction. Clear and meaningful names are crucial for understanding code at a glance, and breaking down complex logic into smaller functions can make code easier to understand and maintain.

## Hint

- Pay attention to variable and function names.
- Look for opportunities to extract logical units into separate functions.

## Code

```php
function calc($a, $b) {
    $x = ($a * 9/5) + 32;
    $y = $b * 0.621371;
    return [$x, $y];
}

$result = calc(30, 100);
echo "Fahrenheit: " . $result[0] . " Miles: " . $result[1];
```
